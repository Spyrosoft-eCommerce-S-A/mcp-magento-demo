# Creating Magento 2 modules using Agentic AI

We have 7 directories with same Magento module:
- 6 of those where created by AI.
- 1 was created by human.

Details:
* We used: Cloud 3.5, Cloude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 4.1, GPT-4o, o4-mini;
* We use VSC with Agent mode;
* We removed all README files that hinted at AI agents;
* No additional works was done on any module except asking models to continue work; 


Time to create a good prompt: 1h
Time to create a running and not throwing errors module by AI in 6 versions: ~4h
Time to create a running and not throwing errors module by human in 1 version: ~16h
